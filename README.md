# Ban Manager
A simple plugin for manually banning people and kicking them on your BeamMP server. Supports multiple servers with one file.

To install just move the main.lua file into `Resources/Server/banman-lite/`. Banlist and perms files need to be one directory up from where the BeamMP-server executable is located. 

To add bans/permissions, just add the names to the appropriate file on separate lines. The banlist and perms list are case sensitive.
