# banman-lite
A very simple plugin for manually banning people on BeamMP servers. Supports multiple servers with one file.

Currently very alpha; if a banned person has the username "Username" and there's a player with the name "Username1", this player would get banned too. Use at your own risk.
To install just move the main.lua file into Resources/Server/banman-lite/. Banlist file needs to be one directory up from where the Beammp-server executable is located.
