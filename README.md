# Ban Manager
A BeamMP plugin for banning and kicking on BeamMP servers. Supports multiple servers with one file.

#### Set up:
To install just move the banman folder into `/Resources/Server/`. Banlist and perms files need to be moved one directory up from where the BeamMP-server executable is located.

To block guest accounts from joining, change allowGuests in main.lua to true. To set the car limit, set carLimit in main.lua to the desired number (the same as the server car limit).

To add bans/permissions, just add the names to the appropriate file on separate lines. The banlist and perms list are case sensitive.

#### Commands:
To kick a player <br>
`/kick (id)` 

To see usernames and ID's (configured for 10 players, wont show all players if player limit is above 10)<br>
`/idmatch`

To ban a player <br>
`/ban (username)`

To ban and kick simultaneously <br>
`/kban (id)`
