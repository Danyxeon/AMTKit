# Ban Manager - Lite
A very simple plugin for manually banning people on BeamMP servers. Supports multiple servers with one file.

To install just move the main.lua file into `Resources/Server/banman-lite/`. Banlist file needs to be one directory up from where the BeamMP-server executable is located. 

To add bans just add the names to the banlist on separate lines. Banlist is case sensitive.
